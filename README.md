# 3D-renderer
 Built using 3D geometry equations, it can render a variety of shapes as long as their co-ordinates  are defined mathematically. 

The renderer can be controlled by the mouse, allowing you to interact with the shapes in real-time. It works by repeatedly printing characters on the console to simulate the 3D effect.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/rashid-360/3d-renderer.git
