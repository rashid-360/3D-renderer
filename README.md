# 3D Renderer

This project implements a 3D renderer using 3D geometry equations. It can render various shapes by defining their coordinates mathematically. The renderer simulates a 3D effect by repeatedly printing characters on the console.

**Key Features:**

* **Mathematical Shape Rendering:** Renders 3D shapes based on coordinate definitions.
* **Real-time Interaction:** Allows interactive control of the shapes using the mouse.
* **Console-based Rendering:** Simulates 3D visualization by character printing.

## Running Instructions

1.  **Clone the Repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/rashid-360/3d-renderer.git](https://github.com/rashid-360/3d-renderer.git)
    ```

2.  **Navigate to the Project Directory:**

    ```bash
    cd 3d-renderer
    ```

3.  **Render a Cube:**

    ```bash
    python3 cube.py
    ```

4.  **Render a 3D Model (Pikachu):**

    ```bash
    python3 pickachu.py
    ```

**Note:**

* The rendered shapes can be rotated using mouse input.
* The project leverages console-based character rendering to create the 3D illusion.
